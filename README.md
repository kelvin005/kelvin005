## 🎯 What I Do

I'm the engineer who sees manual processes and thinks **"there has to be a better way."** While others are clicking through AWS consoles, I've already automated it with Infrastructure as Code and set up monitoring to catch issues before they become problems.

**My obsession:** Building cloud infrastructure so reliable and efficient, it becomes invisible.

**Philosophy:** *"Automate everything. Monitor everything. Break nothing."*

## 🏗️ What I've Built (And Why It Matters)

### 🌤️ [Weather Forecast Application](https://github.com/kelvin005/weather-forecast-application)
**Production-ready serverless app with global scalability**
- **Architecture:** React frontend + Node.js API + external weather APIs
- **Deployment:** Containerized with Docker, automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Why it's impressive:** Handles real-time data processing with optimized caching strategies

### ☁️ [Cloud Dictionary App](https://github.com/kelvin005/cloud-dictionary-app) 
**Fully serverless AWS architecture - zero servers, infinite scale**
- **Tech Stack:** AWS Amplify + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB
- **Infrastructure:** 100% Terraform-managed, fully automated deployments
- **Business Impact:** Pay-per-request pricing = $0 during low usage, scales to millions of requests

### 🐳 [Multi-Node Container Orchestration](https://github.com/kelvin005/container-orchestration)
**Custom-built distributed system management**
- **Challenge:** Reliable containerized workload distribution across multiple nodes  
- **Solution:** Docker + systemd integration with intelligent health monitoring
- **Achievement:** 99.9% uptime with automated failover mechanisms

### 🏗️ [Terraform Modules Library](https://github.com/kelvin005/terraform-aws-modules)
**Production-ready Infrastructure as Code components**
- **Modules:** VPC, ECS, EFS, Security Groups with best practices baked in
- **Impact:** Reduces infrastructure provisioning from days to hours
- **Used by:** Other developers for production deployments

## 💬 Philosophy

> "The best infrastructure is the one you never have to think about. It just works, scales when needed, costs what it should, and tells you when something needs attention."
